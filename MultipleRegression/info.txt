Multiple Regression:

i) Never include both dummy variable as we are just duplicating the varibale, if there is column
like state which have categorical value (ABD, BCD) thn we make two dummy variable A1 and A2
now ultimately A1 = 1-A2, if a variable can be derived from another variable then it is called as linearity, as a result
the model won't be able to distinguish between the effect from A1 and A2.

ii) Rules to follow whenever we make a model always left one dummy varibale if there are 100 dummy variables use only 99
